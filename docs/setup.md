Replace `<REPOSITORY_NAME>` with this project's repository name.

## Setting Up Rust and ICP Development Tools

### Command Execution

Execute the following commands to set up Rust and ICP development tools:

```bash
sh ./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Verifying Setup

Run these commands to verify that the setup completed successfully:

```bash
rustc -V
dfx -V
```

If both commands display version information, the setup was successful.

**Notes**:

- When checking versions, make sure to use capital "V"
- Setup may take several minutes to complete
- After setup, run `exec $SHELL -l` to update shell paths

## Setting Up Subprojects

This project consists of several subprojects.
Execute the following command to set up the subprojects:

```bash
npm run setup
```

## Setting Up Static IP Address

To access the development server on your PC from a smartphone, you need to set up a static IP address.
This ensures the IP address remains unchanged even after PC restart, enabling stable connectivity.

### macOS

1. Open "System Settings" from the Apple menu

2. Click "Network" in the sidebar

3. Select your active network connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and click "Details"

4. Open the "TCP/IP" tab

5. From the "Configure IPv4" dropdown menu, select "Using DHCP with manual address" and enter the following:
   - IP Address
     - Recommended to use range 192.168.0.200-192.168.0.254 to avoid conflicts with DHCP dynamic assignments.
       For example, you could use 192.168.0.210.
   - If you use an address other than 192.168.0.210, please update the IP address in the file below.
     - [../src/frontend/app/+html.tsx](../src/frontend/app/+html.tsx)
     - [../src/frontend/public/.ic-assets.json5](../src/frontend/public/.ic-assets.json5)
     - [../src/ii-integration/public/.ic-assets.json5](../src/ii-integration/public/.ic-assets.json5)

## Creating Server Certificate

To enable HTTPS communication with the previously set static IP address, we'll create a server certificate.

### Preparation

```bash
mkdir .mkcert
cd .mkcert
```

Create and move to a dedicated folder for certificate storage.

### Certificate Creation

```bash
mkcert [static IP address]
```

The following files will be generated:

- [static IP address].pem - Server certificate
- [static IP address]-key.pem - Private key

### Completion

```bash
cd ..
```

Return to the original folder.

**Important Notes**

- Certificate validity period is 27 months
- Never share the private key
- Store certificates in a secure location

## local-ssl-proxy Configuration

Update the ssl:canisters, ssl:ii entries in package.json with your configured static IP address.

### Updating package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ssl:canisters": "local-ssl-proxy --key ./.mkcert/[static IP address]-key.pem --cert ./.mkcert/[static IP address].pem --source 14943 --target 4943",
    "ssl:ii": "local-ssl-proxy --key ./.mkcert/[static IP address]-key.pem --cert ./.mkcert/[static IP address].pem --source 24943 --target 4943"
  }
}
```

Each configuration does the following:

- `--key`: Specifies the path to the private key file
- `--cert`: Specifies the path to the server certificate file
- `--source`: Port number used for HTTPS access
- `--target`: Port number where the actual development server is running

**Important Notes**

- Replace [static IP address] with the static IP address you configured earlier
- Ensure the server certificate and private key file paths match the location of files generated by mkcert

## Starting Local Replica

A local replica is a local execution environment for running Canisters.
Open a new terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dfx:start
```

The local replica will start on port 4943.

### How to Stop Local Replica

To stop the local replica, use either of these methods:

- Press Ctrl+C in the running terminal
- Execute `dfx stop` command in another terminal

**Important Note**
If you see the error `Error: dfx is already running.`, it likely means dfx start is already running. Stop the local replica with dfx stop first, then restart the development server.

## Deploying Canisters for local

To deploy Canisters to the local replica, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dfx:deploy
```

This command performs the following:

1. Builds all Canisters (internet-identity, ii-integration, frontend, backend)
2. Installs the built Canisters to the local replica

**Important Notes**

- dfx:start must be running before deployment
- Deployment may take several minutes to complete

## Deploying Canisters for Playground

To deploy Canisters to the playground, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dfx:deploy:playground
```

## Preparation Steps for ICP Mainnet (ic) Deployment

1. Create and switch to a development identity

```bash
dfx identity new dev
dfx identity use dev
```

2. Get your account's ledger account ID

```bash
dfx ledger account-id
```

3. Send ICP tokens to your ledger account ID

You can obtain ICP tokens from an exchange. If you are using an exchange, initiate a withdrawal transaction, then enter the ledger account ID as the "destination" address to send ICP tokens to.

4. Check your ICP balance

```bash
dfx ledger balance --network=ic
```

5. Convert ICP into cycles

Replace `AMOUNT` with the number of ICP tokens you want to convert into cycles:

```bash
dfx cycles convert --amount AMOUNT --network=ic
```

6. Confirm your cycles balance

```bash
dfx cycles balance --network=ic
```

**Important Notes**

- Make sure you have enough ICP tokens in your account before converting to cycles.
- The conversion rate from ICP to cycles is fixed and determined by the Internet Computer protocol.
- You can check your cycles balance at any time using `dfx cycles balance --network=ic`.
- For more information about cycles and resource consumption, see the [Internet Computer documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/getting-started/tokens-and-cycles).
- For detailed instructions on obtaining cycles, see the [Obtaining cycles](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/getting-started/tokens-and-cycles#obtaining-cycles) section of the Internet Computer documentation.

## Backup and Restore Developer's Private Key

### Export Private Key

```bash
dfx identity export dev > dev.pem
```

This command saves the private key of the dev identity in PEM format to the dev.pem file.

### Import Private Key

```bash
dfx identity import dev dev.pem
```

This imports the private key from the exported PEM file and registers it as the dev identity.

**Important Notes**

- You will be prompted for a passphrase during import
- The passphrase must be at least 8 characters long
- Store your passphrase securely and don't forget it
- The PEM file contains sensitive private key data and must be stored securely
- It is recommended to safely delete the PEM file after successful import

## Deploying Canisters for IC

To deploy Canisters to the IC (Internet Computer), execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dfx:deploy:ic
```

This command performs the following operations:

1. Builds all Canisters (internet-identity, ii-integration, expo-starter-frontend, expo-starter-backend)
2. Installs the built Canisters to the IC mainnet

**Important Notes**

- Deployment may take several minutes
- Mainnet deployment requires cycles for operation

## Starting local-ssl-proxy

Here's how to start local-ssl-proxy

### Launch Commands

```bash
npm run ssl:canisters
npm run ssl:ii
```

These commands do the following:

1. ssl:canisters provides HTTPS connection for Canisters (14943→4943)
2. ssl:ii provides HTTPS connection for Internet Identity (24943→4943)

**Important Notes**

- Run each command in a separate new terminal
- Before running commands, ensure target ports are not in use
- Verify SSL certificate paths are correctly configured
- After launch, each can be stopped individually with Ctrl+C

## Starting Expo Development Server

### Launch Command

```bash
npm run frontend:start
```

This command performs the following:

1. Starts the Expo developer server
2. Displays a QR code
3. Shows an operation menu

### Main Operations

- Press `w` key: Launch app in web browser

### Running on Smartphone

1. Install Expo Go app
2. For iOS: Scan QR code with Camera app
3. For Android: Scan QR code with Expo Go app

**Important Notes**

- PC and smartphone must be connected to the same Wi-Fi
- Stop Expo development server with Ctrl+C

**Android Limitations**

- Local Internet Identity does not work on Android
- Mainnet Internet Identity works
- Please perform Expo Go testing on iOS

## Key Points about Internet Identity

When selecting an Identity on the Choose Identity page, you may get an Unknown Internet Identity error.
This occurs when the local Internet Identity is redeployed after creating an Identity.
The browser remembers the Identity, but the local Internet Identity has forgotten it.
![Unknown Internet Identity](./images/unknown-internet-identity.png)

In such cases, tap More options displayed under Identity. Tap the Create New button in the bottom left. You can recreate Identity 10000.
